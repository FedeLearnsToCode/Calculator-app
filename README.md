# Calculator app

A responsive and theme-switchable calculator built with **React**, styled using **CSS variables** and **Bootstrap**, developed to fulfill the [freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/#front-end-development-libraries-projects), and its design is based on the [Calculator App challenge from Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/calculator-app-9lteq5N29).
